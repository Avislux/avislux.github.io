<h2> What do you even do? </h2>
<p>
    I am currently an undergrad at Cal Poly Pomona finishing up my degree in Computer Engineering. Not working yet.
    My hobbies include music, drawing, video games and occasional programming experiments such as this site. 
</p>
<h2>Any aspirations?</h2>
<p>
    Eventually I would like to be able to create and record my own music using FL Studio or a similar program. 
    I would also like to create my own games starting with small mobile apps, and become a decent artist. Additionally
    I would like to be able to voice act. I guess I like to do everything, but one does not have all the time in the world to
    master it all.
</p>
<h2>So you like playing music. What instruments do you play?</h2>
<p>
    I consider my primary instrument to be drums and percussion. But I also know how to play piano, guitar, bass, violin and flute.
    I do not spend enough time on them to be very decent at them all though. I also enjoy singing.
</p>
<p>As for music production I tend to dream up some beats throughout the day but I never really get a chance to write them down.</p>
<p>I also do some scoring with Sibelius, but I've only made two arrangements so far.</p>
<h2>Art?</h2>
<p>I only recently took up sketching. Not very good. Eventually I'd like to get a drawing tablet and see what I can do with it. </p>
<h2>Voice acting?</h2>
<p>I own a condenser microphone and like to play with it a lot. It has very good recording quality for voice acting and singing. There is not much reverb in my room either
    so it comes out nicely.</p>
