    <h3>In Progress </h3>
    <h4>I work on these from time to time. </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Forbidden Friendship - HTTYD</li>
        <li>Foxy Fakeout - Zootopia</li>
        <li>Lorule Overworld - LoZ: Link Between Worlds</li>
        <li>See You Tomorrow - HTTYD</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rewrites</h3>
    <h4>I often take sheet music I find and change it up because of reasons such as being too many pages.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="spiritedawayonesummer.pdf">One Summer's Day - Spirited Away</a></li>
        <p>Changed from 5 to 3 pages, and some edits to make it more similar to Joe Hisaishi's live performance. Joe's
            performance ends on the second page. The second ending leads to the upbeat transition.</p>
        <li><a href="httydtestdrive.pdf">Test Drive - How to Train Your Dragon arr. Sebastian Wolff (made simpler)</a>
        </li>
        <p>Wanted to learn this piece but the original arrangement was too difficult for me. So I took out several
            notes, as well as a few measures during the fall I didn't like. I still find it moderately difficult.</p>
    </ul>
