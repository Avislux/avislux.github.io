    <div>My guitar playing isn't the most clean but doing it perfectly in one take is hard.</div>

    <h2>Arrangements</h2>
    <h3>Toothless Found </h3>
    <h4><i>How to Train Your Dragon 2</i></h4>
    <h5>Full score</h5>
    <p>Created July 2014. I made this over a course of a month after watching the movie. One of my favorite tracks from the film.</p>

    <h3>Be Your Own You</h3>
    <h4><i>The Amazing World of Gumball</i></h4>
    <h5>Piano</h5>
    <a href="gumball%20be%20your%20own%20you%20-%20Piano.pdf">Download</a>
    <p>Created February 2017. Gumball is one of my favorite shows and I felt that this song would be simple enough to arrange for piano.</p>

    <h3>Memory Recall</h3>
    <h4>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h4>
    <h5>Piano</h5>
    <a href="zeldarecall.pdf">Download</a> <br>
    <a href="zeldarecallv2.pdf">Download version 2</a>
    <p>Created March 2017.<i>Unofficial name.</i> Fell in love with Breath of the Wild and this track plays a few times in the game, so I decided to arrange it.
        This might be awkward to play as the repeating melody isn't comfortably played on one hand. Version two has the melodies more separate. Video TBA</p>

    <h3>Like a Dream Come True</h3>
    <h4>Persona 4</h4>
    <h5>Trumpet part</h5>
    <a href="Persona 4 - Like a Dream Come True Trumpet.pdf">Download</a> <br>
    <p>Created April 2019. Fell in love with Persona over the last few years and tried picking up trumpet slightly because of it. Made this to help me play a song from Persona 4. The second part repeats over and over.</p>

    <h3>Theater</h3>
    <h4>Persona Q2</h4>
    <h5>Full Score</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="Theater - Persona Q2 - Full Score.pdf">Full Score</a></li>
        <li><a href="Theater - Persona Q2 - Flute.pdf">Flute</a></li>
        <li><a href="Theater - Persona Q2 - Clarinet in Bb.pdf">Clarinet Bb</a></li>
        <li><a href="Theater - Persona Q2 - Piano.pdf">Piano</a></li>
        <li><a href="Theater - Persona Q2 - Violin.pdf">Violin</a></li>
        <li><a href="Theater - Persona Q2 - Drum Set.pdf">Drum Set</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Created October 2019. I bought Persona Q2 on launch and finished it in September. I wanted to play the Title Screen song on piano so naturally I needed to write it. Then I decided to do all the instruments. The song uses some kind of clarinet patch but I wrote it for flute as I don't play clarinet. I included both in the score and I think it sounds alright.</p>
    <h3>In Progress</h3>
    <h4>Maybe one day I'll finish these</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Forbidden Friendship - HTTYD (95% done)</li>
        <!--<li>Foxy Fakeout - Zootopia</li>
        <li>Lorule Overworld - LoZ: Link Between Worlds</li>
        <li>See You Tomorrow - HTTYD</li>-->
    </ul>


    <h3>Rewrites</h3>
    <h4>I often take sheet music I find and change it up because of reasons such as being too many pages.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="spiritedawayonesummer.pdf">One Summer's Day - Spirited Away</a></li>
        <p>Changed from 5 to 3 pages, and some edits to make it more similar to Joe Hisaishi's live performance. Joe's
            performance ends on the second page. The second ending leads to the upbeat transition.</p>
        <li><a href="httydtestdrive.pdf">Test Drive - How to Train Your Dragon arr. Sebastian Wolff (made simpler)</a>
        </li>
        <p>Wanted to learn this piece but the original arrangement was too difficult for me. So I took out several
            notes, as well as a few measures during the fall I didn't like. I still find it moderately difficult.</p>
    </ul>
