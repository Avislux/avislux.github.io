<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div>My name is Jonathan. I am a recent graduate of Cal Poly Pomona with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I am currently looking for a job or internship.</div>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Growing up it was evident I was good at math. Back in elementary school in one year I would get 100% on all my tests. In high school I took AP classes.
    The teachers described engineering as an option and since I was good at math I went along with it. I chose mechanical engineering then switched to computer engineering after my first year.
    I thought it was the perfect fit for me, however the cirriculum was essentially all of the important electrical engineering classes with a side of computer science. It was not a bad cirriculum; I liked the
    labs. But i don't actually know what of that lab work is relevant to what goes on in the industry. We did circuit analysis in time and frequency domain, FPGA stuff, digital circuits, some microcontroller stuff.
</p>
    <p>Ultimately some of it was rough. Much of the math-heavy classes took more time to study for but outside of those few the classes were not that hard. Maybe I feel like I did not put as much time
    as I could have into some of those other classes. I did what I thought was enough to get through. And I did, in four years.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't enough. It was not enough to get me a job or internship during college. I had a seizure the first year of college. My license was revoked for a year and a half.
    Neurologist wouldn't clear me<!-- and he died before he was able to-->. During that time it was discouraging for me to look for jobs and I did not want to depend on family to get me to places.
    It was naive of me. I totally could have worked. I had my license back winter quarter of junior year. I started applying slowly. I figured I was too busy with school for more extracurriculars. Maybe I could have done more.
    I started to try to do more things in senior year but I was not organized enough. End of junior year I said I would start applying. I didn't know by that time it was too late for most internships. I tried for a couple weeks in summer
    and gave up quickly.

    </p>
    <p>Senior year I figured I was too busy with school work to continuously job hunt. Although I kept applying, going to career center information sessions, carreer fairs. I had a few interviews.
    Didn't do too well on any of them. By the end of senior  year I knew it was going to be a problem. I would not have a job out of college. Now I am stuck here. No experience and no job. Internships are hard to find.
    All of them seem to require that you are still enrolled. </p>

    <p> I pass the time trying to learn things, work on some projects, or playing music or games. I want to become a good programmer. I have to keep trying to do stuff.
        There's not enough time in the world for everything.
         I want to make games, voice act, record music, play games and more. <br/>
        But I could use some assistance.</p>
